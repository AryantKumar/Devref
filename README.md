## 🧠 How the Random Quiz Generator Works

This is the heart of the app's interactive learning system. Here is the complete flow, with file references:

### Step 1 — User Picks a Topic
**File:** [`quiz_screen.dart`](lib/presentation/quiz/quiz_screen.dart)

The Quiz tab displays all 17 topics in a grid. Each card shows the topic name, icon, and the number of available questions (e.g., "40 questions"). Tapping a card navigates to:
```
/quiz/{topicId}/play
```

### Step 2 — Loading & Shuffling Questions
**File:** [`quiz_play_screen.dart`](lib/presentation/quiz/quiz_play_screen.dart) — `_loadQuestions()` method (line 42)

```dart
Future<void> _loadQuestions() async {
    // 1. Fetch ALL snippets for the chosen topic from Isar
    final snippets = await ref.read(topicSnippetsProvider(widget.topicId).future);

    // 2. Create a Random number generator
    final rng = Random();

    // 3. Shuffle the entire list in-place (Fisher-Yates algorithm)
    final shuffled = List<Snippet>.from(snippets)..shuffle(rng);

    // 4. Take only the first 10 → These become our questions
    _questions = shuffled.take(10).toList();

    // 5. For EACH question, generate 4 multiple-choice options:
    for (var q in _questions) {
        final correct = q.title;  // The correct answer is the snippet's title

        // Pick 3 WRONG answers from OTHER snippets in the same topic
        final others = snippets.where((s) => s.snippetId != q.snippetId).toList()
          ..shuffle(rng);
        final wrongs = others.take(3).map((s) => s.title).toList();

        // Combine and shuffle all 4 options randomly
        final allOptions = [correct, ...wrongs]..shuffle(rng);
        _options.add(allOptions);
        _correctIndices.add(allOptions.indexOf(correct));
    }
}
```

**Key insight:** Each snippet has a `code` block and a `title`. The quiz shows the **code** and asks *"What does this code do?"* — the correct answer is the snippet's `title`, and the 3 wrong answers are titles from other snippets in the same topic. This ensures distractors are contextually plausible (they're all from the same language).

### Step 3 — Question Presentation
The screen rotates through 3 question templates based on the current index:
```dart
static const _questionTemplates = [
    'What does this code do?',
    'What is the output of this code?',
    'What concept does this demonstrate?',
];
```

Each question displays:
- A **progress bar** (current question / total)
- The **difficulty badge** (very_easy, medium, hard, very_hard)
- The actual **code block** with syntax highlighting
- **4 multiple-choice options** — tapping locks the answer
- On answer: **green highlight** for correct, **red** for wrong, plus an **explanation** (the snippet's description)

### Step 4 — Results Screen
**File:** [`quiz_result_screen.dart`](lib/presentation/quiz/quiz_result_screen.dart)

After all 10 questions, the app navigates to `/quiz/{topicId}/result` with the score, total, and full answer breakdown passed as route `extra`. The results screen shows:
- A score circle (green if ≥70%, red otherwise)
- A per-question breakdown (✅ correct / ❌ wrong + correct answer)
- **Retry** button (regenerates a fresh quiz) or **Change Language** button

### Why Every Quiz Session Is Unique
Because the shuffle uses `dart:math Random()` seeded by the system clock, and we shuffle at two levels:
1. **Which 10 snippets** are picked (from a pool of 40 per topic)
2. **The order of the 4 options** within each question

This means even retrying the same topic gives a different quiz every time.

### Technical Highlights
- **Clean Architecture:** Fully decoupled architecture using `ISnippetRepository` and `ITopicRepository` to isolate local database logic from the UI.
- **Offline-First:** Seamless functionality without internet, utilizing high-performance Isar NoSQL for instant querying.
- **State Management:** Fully reactive declarative UI built cleanly using Riverpod 2.0+ `Notifier`s and dependency injection.
- **Micro-animations & Shimmers:** Premium enterprise-grade user experience featuring skeleton loading.
- **Multi-threaded Data Parsing:** Optimized JSON-to-database heavy lifting via background Isolates.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework::** Flutter
- **State Management:** Riverpod (`Notifier` & `Provider`)

### Isar NoSQL Database
**File:** [`isar_datasource.dart`](lib/data/datasources/isar_datasource.dart)

The app uses **Isar** — an ultra-fast, zero-latency local NoSQL database for Flutter. It uses a singleton pattern:

```dart
static Isar? _isar;

static Future<Isar> get instance async {
    if (_isar != null && _isar!.isOpen) return _isar!;
    final dir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
    _isar = await Isar.open([TopicSchema, SnippetSchema], directory: dir.path);
    return _isar!;
}
```

### Data Models

| Model | Fields | File |
|-------|--------|------|
| **Topic** | `topicId`, `name`, `iconPath`, `colorHex`, `snippetCount` | [`topic.dart`](lib/data/models/topic.dart) |
| **Snippet** | `snippetId`, `topicId`, `title`, `description`, `code`, `language`, `difficulty`, `isSaved`, `lastViewedAt` | [`snippet.dart`](lib/data/models/snippet.dart) |

### Seed Architecture
**File:** [`seed_manager.dart`](lib/data/seed/seed_manager.dart)

On the very first launch, the `SeedManager` checks a `SharedPreferences` flag (`seeded_v5`). If not set:
1. Clears existing data (handles version upgrades)
2. Bulk-inserts all 17 `Topic` records in a single Isar write transaction
3. Bulk-inserts all 677+ `Snippet` records in a single write transaction
4. Sets the seed flag to prevent re-seeding

Each language has its own seed file (e.g., `snippets_kotlin.dart`, `snippets_python.dart`) containing 40 snippets distributed across 4 difficulty levels:
- **10 Very Easy** — Basics (Hello World, variables, loops)
- **10 Medium** — Intermediate (generics, patterns, collections)
- **10 Hard** — Advanced (concurrency, metaprogramming)
- **10 Very Hard** — Expert (compiler internals, unsafe code, type theory)

### Why 677+ Snippets Don't Cause Performance Issues

1. **Bulk Transactions:** All snippets are inserted in a single `writeTxn` using `putAll()` — not one-by-one. This keeps the DB write time minimal.
2. **Lazy Rendering:** All list views use `SliverChildBuilderDelegate` / `ListView.builder`, not `ListView(children: [...])`. Only visible items are rendered.
3. **Isar's Zero-Copy Architecture:** Isar maps data directly to memory structures — no JSON parsing, no heavy ORM layer. Reads are near-instantaneous.
4. **Indexed Queries:** `topicId` and `difficulty` are `@Index()` annotated, so filtered queries run in O(log n) time.
5. **Provider Caching:** The `allTopicsProvider` uses `ref.keepAlive()` — the 17 topics are fetched once and cached for the app's lifetime. Other providers auto-dispose when the screen is left.

## 🧭 Navigation

**File:** [`app_router.dart`](lib/core/router/app_router.dart)

The app uses **GoRouter** with `StatefulShellRoute.indexedStack` for persistent bottom navigation across 5 tabs:

| Tab | Route | Screen |
|-----|-------|--------|
| Home | `/` | Dashboard with topics, roadmaps, recently viewed |
| Browse | `/browse` | All 17 topics in a grid |
| Quiz | `/quiz` | Quiz topic picker |
| Saved | `/saved` | Bookmarked snippets |
| Roadmaps | `/roadmap` | 8 career roadmaps |

Detail screens use `parentNavigatorKey: _rootNavigatorKey` to render on top of the shell (full-screen), with custom slide transitions:
- `/browse/:topicId` → Topic detail with difficulty filter chips
- `/snippet/:snippetId` → Full snippet view with syntax highlighting
- `/quiz/:topicId/play` → Active quiz session
- `/quiz/:topicId/result` → Quiz results breakdown
- `/roadmap/:id` → Roadmap step-by-step detail
- `/search` → Full-text search overlay

## 🎨 Theming

**Files:** [`app_theme.dart`](lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart), [`app_colors.dart`](lib/core/theme/app_colors.dart), [`theme_provider.dart`](lib/domain/providers/theme_provider.dart)

- **Material 3** enabled with curated GitHub-inspired dark/light colour palettes
- **Google Fonts (Inter)** for typography across all text styles
- **Fira Code** for code blocks
- Theme controlled by `ThemeNotifier` (Riverpod `Notifier`) with:
  - Default: follows **system theme** (`ThemeMode.system`)
  - Manual override: user taps the animated sun/moon toggle → persists to `SharedPreferences`
  - On next launch: if a manual override exists, it's restored; otherwise system theme is used
